Are you going? It’s still a long time until daybreak. Don’t be afraid. That sound you heard was the 
NIGHTINGALE
The lark sings in the morning, the nightingale sings at night.
nightingale, not the lark. Every night the nightingale chirps on that pomegranate-tree. Believe me, my love, it was the nightingale.

That light is not daylight, I know it. It’s some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua. So stay for a while. You don’t have to go yet.

It is, it is. Get out of here, be gone, go away! It’s the lark that sings so out of tune, making such harsh noise. Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night. It’s not true because she separates us. 
SOME SAY THE LARK TRADED ITS EYES WITH THE TOAD
A folktale said that the lark had gotten its ugly eyes from the toad, who had taken its pretty eyes from the lark.
Some say the lark traded its eyes with the toad. Oh, now I wish they had traded voices too! Because the lark’s voice tears us out of each other’s arms, and now there will be men hunting for you. Oh, go away now. I see more and more light.
